Our data service aims to be a comprehensive source of information related
to the film industry.
These are some of the use cases for our data service:

- As a film producer you can use our predictive models to optimise the money you
spend by gathering directors and actors who have the highest probability to
create a hit film

- As a film critic, you can use our data service to decide which movies will be
worth you time to see first depending on how their predicted quality (IMDB score)

- As an investor, you can use our model to predict how upcoming movies are likely
to fare in the box office and use this as a means to direct your capital to
studios or production companies you are interested in investing in.

- As a film fan website, you can get rich stats on the popularity of movies,
actors and directors and use this as a base for visualisation or literature you
may wish to write

- Cinema owners can gain insights into how to prioritise films in their shows
based on their predicted ratings and the popularity of the director, screenwriters
and cast

- By deploying this application on your server, you also can see insights on how
this API is called and gauge interest for certain directors, actors, movies,
keywords and more!

The above use cases only scratch the surface on what customers of our data service
have been able to do!
