Use case:
Movie producer/ (or company i.e. netflix) optimising for money:
gathers directors and actors together to make a movie to make money

in a negotiation of how much an actor/ director should be paid. 
(i.e. i want $3 million since this api predicts hiring me makes the movie $6 million extra)

you're a movie reviewer deciding which movies to see premier
(i.e. i'm making 8 reviews in the next week, high scoring movies get the most youtube views so i'll watch these movies)

you're on the stock market investing in movie companies, seeing how upcoming movies do impacts the stock price
(i.e. new disney movie is gonna be huge, buy stocks now)

you're a website that recommends movies to see premier. The imdb score predictor tells if it's worth seeing/

you're a gossip website that wants to show the top actor on their home screen
(like a live Time person of the year but for actors)

you're a movie theatre chain to increase sales you display the highest movie on your webpage

you're a server owner and you want to see how much your api is called 
(how interest there is for a given actor/movie/genre over time etc.)
